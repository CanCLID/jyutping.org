- Add comments sparsely. Comments should be added solely for explaining code.
  - ✔️ `// Do not split at fullwidth spaces, which are useful in lyrics`
  - ✔️ `// Find the topmost visible heading based on intersection ratio and position`
  - ✔️ `// Setup observer slightly delayed to ensure elements are in the DOM`
  - ✔️ `// Handle edge case: ...`
- DO NOT add meta-commentary, i.e. comments about the action you have just performed.
  - ❌ `// Added ...`
  - ❌ `// Modified ...`
  - ❌ `// Adjusted ...`
  - ❌ `// Changed ...`
  - ❌ `// Removed ...`
  - ❌ `// Copied from ...`
  - ❌ `// Replaced ... with ...`
  - ❌ `// Use ... instead of ...`
  - ❌ `// Define ...`
- DO NOT add comments hinting next steps. Recommendations should stay in the conversation.
  - ❌ `{/* Adjust styles as needed */}`
  - ❌ `{/* Add other props if necessary */}`
- DO NOT add file names to the top of a file.
  - ❌ `// src/utils.ts`
  - ❌ `// src/index.astro`
- Avoid self-explanatory comments. Only add comments if the code is not obvious.
  - ❌ `import React from "react"; // Import React`
  - ❌ `return I18n.locales.filter((locale) => locale !== I18n.defaultLocale) // Exclude default locale`
  - ❌ `observer.disconnect(); // Disconnect observer on cleanup`
- Within a large block of JSX, add labels sparsely.
  - ✔️ `{/* Header */}`
  - ✔️ `{/* Main Container */}`
- When removing code, eliminate entirely. DO NOT comment out code.

- Translation locales should be sorted in alphabetical order.
