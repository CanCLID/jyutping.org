## The design principles for romanization systems

Cantonese uses Chinese characters (a.k.a. Han characters, or Sinogram) as its writing system. However, Chinese characters are logographic, not phonographic. So we need a phonographic transcription system to represent the sounds of Cantonese. Such a system is called a romanization system. Therefore, the first priority of a romanization system is to accurately transcribe the phonology, or the sound system of a language. Additionally, in our 21th century Internet era, romanization systems are also useful in making input methods(IME) and other digitization tools. Starting from these utility concerns, we can summarize a set of principles and criteria for designing a romanization system. We will dive into these principles, examine some extant Cantonese romanization systems accordingly, and explain why Jyutping should be our choice.

### Principle #1："One symbol to one phoneme mapping"

To accurately represent the phonology of a language, a Romanization system should strictly follow the rule: **one symbol always maps to only one phoneme and vice versa**. If one symbol can map to multiple phonemes, or one phoneme can be represented by multiple symbols in a romanization system, we can say that this system is inconsistent, unable to represent the phonology both accurately and concisely.

One familiar example is the Mandarin Pinyin. In Pinyin, letter e is a phonemic transcription. It is pronounced /ɤ/ when preceded by initials g, k, h, and pronounced /e/ in the final ie, However, in Pinyin, initials j q x are phonetic transcriptions. They share the same phonemes with g k h, which means, the same phonemes can be represented by either g k h or j q x. Pinyin transcribes sounds both phonemically and phonetically. This introduces inconsistency and violates our first principle.

Principle #1 also implies another rule of thumb: the sound that a symbol represents **should not depend on that symbol's environment** (the symbol that precedes it and the one that follows it). One good example is the Yale romanization for Cantonese. In Yale, the letter _a_ can represent two vowel phonemes, /a/ and /ɐ/. The table below shows the Yale romanizations for three characters 花 翻 分. We can see that in open syllable (syllables that don't end with consonants) characters, which is the character 花 in this case, letter a represents the vowel /a/. While in closed syllable characters, it represents another vowel phoneme /ɐ/ (分 in the table). This is what we call "one symbol _a_ maps to two phonemes /a/ and /ɐ/". Similarly, 花 and 翻 share the same vowel /a/, but in 花 it is transcribed as _fa_ while in 翻 it is _faan_, which is "one phoneme /a/ can be represented by two symbols _aa_ and _a_".

| 花 /a/ <Audio client:load id="faa1" /> | 翻 /a/ <Audio client:load id="faan1" /> | 分 /ɐ/ <Audio client:load id="fan1" /> |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| fa                         | faan                        | fan                        |

So in Yale romanization, "the sound of a symbol depends on its environment". Whether the letter _a_ represents /a/ or /ɐ/ depends on whether the syllable is open or closed (if followed by _n_, it is /ɐ/; if followed by nothing, it is /a/). This creates a lot of ambiguities and inconsistencies, and is one of Yale's critical design flaws. In Jyutping, **aa** consistently represents /a/ and **a** consistently represents /ɐ/, so you can determine the sound directly without considering the environment.

### Principle #2: Avoid using non-ASCII characters.

A romanization system should try to limit its symbol usage to [ASCII codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) only. In other words, the system should try to use the 26 English letters and Arabic numbers only, and avoid using diacritics like ´ˋˇ˘˜.

A perfect example is the ü in Mandarin Pinyin. We all know how troublesome it is to type the letter _ü_ with American keyboards. Most people have to look for a special character input app to type it. Aside from being troublesome, _ü_ does not belong to the ASCII code set, which means it can't be encoded in the simplest form (unless you transcode it into _v_). This increases both the memory usage and the risk of bugs. Pinyin also uses diacritics like ˉˊˇˋ to mark the tones, which are like the _ü_, not supported by the ASCII encoding.

We know that romanization systems have another important use case, which is making input method software. If a romanization system is full of diacritics like ˉˊˇˋ, how would people type? Fortunately, in Mandarin Pinyin, these symbols are only used for tone marking, and Pinyin input methods work fine even without tone marks. However, if these symbols were used not only for tones but also to distinguish consonants and vowels, like â ä ô ö û ü, it would be a disaster—the input method could become so cumbersome that nobody would want to use it.

### Principle #3: Symbol choices should follow common conventions

This principle means that when choosing letters to represent sounds, we should follow common expectations. For example, letters a, o, e are generally used for vowels, b, p, m, f for labial sounds, and so on. A famous counterexample is the Cherokee writing system, which uses the letter Ꭰ to represent the sound /a/ and the letter Ꮃ to represent /la/—very counterintuitive. Another example is the _q_ in Mandarin Pinyin representing /t͡ɕʰ/, which doesn't align with English speakers' expectations. Since in English _q_ typically represents /k/, when Western learners first encounter Pinyin's _q_, they instinctively pronounce it as /k/, and it takes time to adjust.

Jyutping is often criticized for using the letter _j_ to represent the sound /j/ <Audio client:load id="jaa1" />, because this violates this principle—people are used to using the letter _y_ to represent /j/, so using _j_ feels unfamiliar. We will explain this in detail [below](#on-j-and-y).

### Principle #4: Accurately reflect the language's phonemic system

This can be considered the most important design principle, but it's also the most troublesome and error-prone. Phonemic analysis involves some subjectivity, and sometimes a language's phonemic system cannot be completely determined. The most familiar example is Mandarin, where the academic community still lacks consensus on the number of vowel phonemes in Mandarin (for instance, whether to consider rhotacized vowels affects the analysis). These differences directly impact romanization design, sometimes affecting the system's expressive capacity, and in severe cases, preventing the system from representing certain sounds.

It should be noted that this principle sometimes conflicts with Principle #1. For example, in English, the sounds _h_ and _ng_ are in complementary distribution and could theoretically be grouped as the same phoneme and represented by the same letter, but this would be very counterintuitive and unsuitable for general use. We will encounter such trade-offs between Principle #1 and Principle #3 in the examples below.

## Flaws in other Cantonese romanization systems

Having understood the design principles of romanization systems, we can now examine the most prominent Cantonese romanization systems: Yale romanization, the Education Institute romanization scheme (Educomp), and the Guangzhou romanization scheme (Rao Bingcai scheme). We'll analyze their design issues and demonstrate why we should choose Jyutping.

### Yale romanization

Yale romanization is probably the most common Cantonese romanization system besides Jyutping. Compared to Jyutping, it has the following main differences:

1. In Yale romanization, /a/ is represented by _a_ in open syllables and _aa_ in closed syllables. /ɐ/ is represented by _a_ in closed syllables, and open syllable /ɐ/ cannot be represented.
2. Yale uses _j_, _ch_, _y_ to represent the three sounds /ts/, /tsʰ/, /j/. Therefore, the vowel /yː/ needs to be represented by _yu_.
3. Yale does not distinguish between /ɵ/ and /œ/, representing both with _eu_. As a result, Yale cannot represent the sound /ɛːu/.
4. Yale uses diacritics ˉˊ and the letter _h_ to mark tones (the new version added numerical tone marking).

First, point #1 was already discussed [above](#principle-1-one-symbol-to-one-phoneme-mapping). Yale was designed this way because the phonemic analysis at the time believed that open syllable /ɐ/ did not exist, so they simply abbreviated open syllable _aa_ to _a_. This abbreviation creates problems: first, it violates our Principle #1 "one symbol strictly corresponds to one phoneme," confusing learners and increasing learning costs. Second, it makes it impossible to represent open syllable /ɐ/ characters, such as the sentence-final particle "la," violating Principle #4. This is a major design flaw.

Regarding point #2, Yale's use of _yu_ to represent /yː/ also violates Principle #1 "one symbol corresponds to one phoneme," because it requires context to determine what sound is actually represented. Yale already uses _y_ to represent /j/ and _u_ to represent /u/, but now stipulates that _yu_ combined represents /yː/—in other words, "one letter represents one monophthong, and two letters combined represent another monophthong." This confuses learners and is inconvenient for computer information processing (input methods have difficulty handling abbreviations, and regular expressions require environmental context). We will further explain how Jyutping handles this issue in the final section on [Jyutping's flaws](#jyutpings-flaws).

Point #3: Yale uses _eu_ to represent both /ɵ/ and /œ/, which is the phonemic analysis problem mentioned in Principle #4. This directly prevents Yale from representing sounds like /œ/ and /ɛːu/, limiting the system's expressive capacity, as shown in the table below:

|                | 睡 /sɵi˨/ <Audio client:load id="seoi6" /> | 掉 /tɛːu˨/ <Audio client:load id="deu6" /> | 𠰲 /œt˨/ <Audio client:load id="oet6" /> |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Yale           | seuih                          | Cannot represent               | Cannot represent             |
| Jyutping       | seoi6                          | deu6                           | oet6                         |

Point #4: Using diacritics and _h_ to mark tones—for example, spelling the pronunciation of "snake" as _sèh_—violates both Principle #2 and Principle #1, since _h_ is already used to represent the initial consonant /h/. Fortunately, the new version of Yale has added numerical tone marking, which greatly helps information processing.

In summary, Yale's design violates Principles #1, #2, and #4 (Principle #3 is subjective and cannot be definitively judged). These design flaws are sufficient reason to abandon Yale and adopt Jyutping instead.

### Guangzhou Romanization (Rao Bingcai scheme)

The Guangzhou Romanization was announced by the Guangdong Provincial Government in 1960, and later revised in 1980. Because it was revised by Professor Rao Bingcai, it's also known as the Rao Bingcai scheme. We'll use the 1980 revised version here to explain this system's design problems. Apart from tones, the main differences between Guangzhou Romanization and Jyutping are:

1. It uses _e_, _ê_, _é_, _ü_ to represent the vowels /ɐ/, /œː/, /ɛː/, /yː/ respectively
2. It uses _y_ to represent the consonant /j/, and _gu_, _ku_ to represent /kʷ/, /kʷʰ/
3. It uses both _z c s_ and _j q x_ to represent /ts/, /tsʰ/, /s/, with the two sets having no actual difference—they represent the same phonemes
4. Checked tone finals use _-b -d -g_
5. It doesn't distinguish between /ɵ/ and /œ/, and cannot represent the Jyutping sound _oet_

Clearly, point #1 completely violates Principle #2 by using many diacritics for vowels. This seriously hinders computer information processing and makes it impossible to use for input methods. Point #3 violates Principle #1: the same phoneme is represented by different symbols. This design was originally meant to be compatible with Mandarin Pinyin, but it's completely unnecessary and actually increases confusion.

Points #2 and #4 are more subjective symbol choices and can't be considered flaws. Point #5 is the same as Yale—it cannot represent the Jyutping syllables _oet_ and _eu_. Overall, points #1 and #3 are the most serious flaws, and these directly determine that the Guangzhou Romanization cannot be popularized in the information age.

### Institute of Language in Education Romanization (Cantonese Pinyin)

The Institute of Language in Education (ILE) romanization, commonly known as Cantonese Pinyin, is another commonly used Cantonese romanization system besides Yale and Jyutping. The ILE's Language Institute published the "List of Cantonese Pronunciation of Commonly-used Chinese Characters" in 1990, using numbers for tone marking. Apart from tones, its main differences from Jyutping are:

1. It uses _dz_ and _ts_ to represent /ts/ and /tsʰ/
2. It uses _y_ to represent /y/
3. It doesn't distinguish between /ɵ/ and /œ/, uniformly using _oe_ to represent both
4. It uses _oey_ to represent what is _eoi_ in Jyutping

Overall, Cantonese Pinyin is quite close to Jyutping, with a relatively scientific design. Points #2 and #4 are subjective symbol choices, not flaws. Point #3 was already discussed above. Only point #1 is a minor flaw. Using _dz_ and _ts_—besides being unnecessarily long—also affects input method encoding. For example, many input methods have initial consonant abbreviation features. If I type `ts`, should it be recognized as the initial of "此" (this), or the initials of "聽寫" (dictation)? This increases collision rates, raises processing costs, and makes the input method harder to use.

### Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanization / Postal Romanization

The Hong Kong Government Cantonese Romanization (with Postal Romanization inheriting from the Hong Kong Government system) refers generally to the romanization used by the Hong Kong Government for spelling street names and personal names. Because it originated from early Westerners' practices of spelling Cantonese with Latin letters, it uses many diacritics, such as ' for aspiration, ò for /ou/, ü for /y/, etc. However, diacritics cannot be used in English, so Hong Kong Government documents remove all these diacritics, leading to much confusion. Additionally, the government doesn't mandate spelling in standard Guangzhou pronunciation—different people can spell using their own dialectal pronunciations, resulting in "one character having multiple spellings" and "one spelling representing different sounds," for example:

- "蔡" (coi3) has three spellings: _Choi_, _Choy_, _Tsoi_
- "葉" (jip6) has two spellings: _Yip_, _Ip_
- _Chun_ can represent "俊" (zeon3) or "珍" (zan1)
- _Chai_ can represent "柴" (caai4) or "仔" (zai2)

Strictly speaking, the Hong Kong Government romanization cannot be considered a romanization system because it cannot fulfill the most basic function of a romanization system—accurately and consistently representing the phonological system of a language—which means it completely violates Principle #1. Therefore, this romanization can neither serve as a dictionary system nor as an input method, giving us even more reason not to use it.

## Jyutping's flaws

### On j and y

The most common complaint about Jyutping is the letter _j_. Many people ask why we don't use _y_ to represent /j/, since this would align with common conventions—both Mandarin Pinyin and English use _y_ for /j/. So why does Jyutping violate Principle #3 by using _j_ instead of _y_? Because if we used _y_ to represent /j/, it would raise a question: there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, and if we use _y_ for /j/, what do we use to represent /y/?

For this question, Yale's answer is: use _y_ for /j/, then use context to determine when it represents /y/. If the letter _y_ is followed by _u_, then the two letters _yu_ together represent /y/. This is what we mentioned earlier as "one letter represents one monophthong, and two combined represent another monophthong." In other words, **Yale sacrifices Principle #1 to achieve Principle #3**, so this is a trade-off. Which principle is more important? Definitely the first one—"one symbol corresponds to one phoneme" is the most important. Because the fundamental purpose of a romanization system is to accurately represent a language's phonemic system, and breaking this one-to-one correspondence brings many problems, such as the increased learning and information processing costs, and susceptibility to confusion, as discussed above.

On the other hand, using _j_ to represent /j/ isn't such a violation of Principle #3, because using _y_ for /j/ is merely a convention in Mandarin Pinyin and English. There are many other writing systems in the world—for example, German also uses _j_ to represent /j/. So actually, only Mandarin Pinyin and English users find this design unfamiliar; German speakers would find it quite natural. Moreover, everyone can see that in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the symbol for this sound (palatal approximant) is /j/, so Jyutping follows the IPA notation.

### The final yu

If we're really talking about genuine design flaws in Jyutping, there is indeed one: using two letters _yu_ to represent the vowel /y/ seems unnecessarily long—a single _y_ could work just as well without side effects. LSHK originally designed it this way out of consideration for common conventions and legacy issues (Principle #3). However, the good news is that most Jyutping input methods on the market support _y_ as an abbreviation for _yu_, so when typing, if you're too lazy to type both letters, typing just _y_ works perfectly fine.

Regarding Jyutping's design, LSHK's official website has its own [FAQ](https://www.lshk.org/faq-on-jyutping), which you can refer to for understanding the various issues considered during the design process.

So what? Use Jyutping!
