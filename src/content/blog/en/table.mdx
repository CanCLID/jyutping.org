Currently, in public domain publications such as books and media, besides Jyutping, we can find several different Cantonese romanization systems. For beginners, encountering so many different Cantonese romanization systems can be quite confusing. This article provides a comparison between Jyutping and four commonly used Cantonese romanization systems: Guangzhou Romanization, Cantonese Pinyin, Yale, and Sidney Lau, to help readers distinguish between them and better learn and use Jyutping.

<Alert title="The five Cantonese romanization systems listed in this article">

- **Jyutping (LSHK Jyutping Romanization Scheme)**: Developed by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong in 1993. It is currently the simplest, most reasonable, and easiest-to-learn Cantonese romanization system in common use.
- **Guangzhou Romanization**: Formulated by the Guangdong Provincial Education Department in 1960 and revised by Rao Bingcai in the 1980s.
- **Cantonese Pinyin (Institute of Language in Education Scheme)**: The Institute of Language in Education's Language Institute published the "List of Cantonese Pronunciation of Commonly-used Chinese Characters" in 1990, using numbers for tone marking. The later-developed Jyutping scheme shares many similarities with Cantonese Pinyin, but Jyutping's design is more refined. It has gained wider application and support in both academic and daily life, and Jyutping has gradually replaced Cantonese Pinyin.
- **Yale Romanization**: Co-developed by Parker Po-fei Huang and Gerald P. Kok. Commonly found in textbooks and books for teaching Cantonese to foreigners.
- **Sidney Lau Romanization**: Developed by Sidney Lau in 1972. Commonly found in textbooks and books for teaching Cantonese to foreigners.

</Alert>

These five are the most common Cantonese romanization systems found in current public domain publications. Besides these, other systems such as the S. L. Wong scheme and the Meyer-Wempe scheme have appeared historically, but in contemporary times, they are rarely used anymore and are limited to historical documents. Beginners are unlikely to encounter them. Therefore, this article will not list them.

> - The example characters in the table above only represent their initial consonants.
> - In the Guangzhou scheme, there is no phonetic difference between _z_, _c_, _s_ and _j_, _q_, _x_—they are merely variants used before different vowels. Specifically, in Guangzhou romanization, _j_, _q_, _x_ are used when the vowel is _i_ or _ü_; _z_, _c_, _s_ are used for other vowels.

> - The example characters in the table above only represent their finals.
> - Finals marked with `*` only appear in colloquial speech. Specifically:
>   - The Jyutping finals _eu_, _em_, _en_, _ep_, _et_ are not defined in the original Guangzhou, ILE, Yale, and Sidney Lau schemes. Guangzhou, ILE, and Sidney Lau can extrapolate these five finals based on existing rules, and Yale can extrapolate the latter four finals, shown in the table with `()`. However, the spelling _eu_ is already used in Yale to spell the [œː] final, so the Jyutping _eu_ final cannot be extrapolated, shown in the table with `-`.
>   - The Jyutping final _oet_ [œːt] is used in situations like the onomatopoeia "𠰲" (vomiting sound), contrasting with the _eot_ [ɵt] final. The original Guangzhou, ILE, and Yale schemes do not define the _oet_ final. The first three schemes treat vowels [œ] and [ɵ] as the same phoneme, so they cannot extrapolate the Jyutping _oet_ final, shown in the table with `-`. The Sidney Lau scheme treats vowels [ʊ~o] and [ɵ] as the same phoneme, with vowel [œ] as a separate phoneme, so it can extrapolate the Jyutping _oet_ final, shown in the table with `()`.

> - Yale romanization generally uses tone marks for tones, and adds an _h_ after vowels for lower register tones. When tone marks are inconvenient, it also uses numbers for tone marking.
> - Cantonese Guangzhou dialect has two tone values for High Level tone, 53 and 55, also called "upper high level" and "lower high level" respectively. In modern Cantonese, these two tone values are generally free variants with no particular distinction, so Jyutping, Guangzhou, and ILE all use tone number 1 to represent High Level tone; while Yale and Sidney Lau distinguish between these two tone values.
> - For the three checked tones, ILE can use either 7, 8, 9 or 1, 3, 6 for marking.
