  The Simplified Chinese Character scheme was designed specifically for Mandarin and is problematic when used to write Cantonese.

import Alert from "@/components/Alert.tsx";

The [Chinese Character Simplification Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters) currently in use in mainland China was formulated by the Committee for Research on Chinese Language Reform in the 1950s. Its design inherited from the simplified character tables of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee. Among these simplified characters, some were simplified based on the principle of [merging homophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_of_homophonous_characters_in_simplified_Chinese), serving as a transitional step toward the ultimate goal of [Romanization of Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese).

This simplification method has two problems. First, **the merging of homophones is based on Mandarin/Guoyu pronunciation, without considering the pronunciations of non-Mandarin languages**. Therefore, if simplified characters are used to write Cantonese, many characters that have different pronunciations and meanings in Cantonese will be merged into one form, increasing ambiguity and unnecessarily raising communication and learning costs. **The most common examples include:**

- 松鼠 (cung4 syu2, pine squirrel) being misread as 鬆鼠 (sung1 syu2, loose squirrel)
- 鬍鬚 (wu4 sou1, beard) being misread as 鬍須 (wu4 seoi1, beard must)
- 錶面 (biu1 min6, watch face) and 表面 (biu2 min6, surface) becoming indistinguishable
- 船隻進入運河 (syun4 zek3 zeon3 jap6 wan6 ho4, ships enter the canal) becoming ambiguous as 船只进入运河 (syun4 zi2 zeon3 jap6 wan6 ho4, ship only enter canal)

Table 1 below documents all such characters.

The second problem is that the simplified character scheme also includes characters simplified by changing phonetic components, and these phonetic component changes are often based on Mandarin pronunciation. This causes **the phonetic components of simplified characters to conflict with actual Cantonese pronunciation. For example, "warship" simplified to "军舰" is easily misread by beginners as "军见"**. Table 2 below summarizes some such characters. Due to the large number, this is an incomplete list, and community contributions are welcome.

<Alert title="Simplified Chinese version of this site">
  Although this site provides a [Simplified Chinese Cantonese version](/yue_hans), it is only for beginners' transitional adaptation. Using traditional characters makes it easier to learn Cantonese pronunciation patterns. Learners should aim to ultimately write Cantonese with traditional characters.
