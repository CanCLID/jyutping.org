  The Simplified Chinese Character scheme was designed specifically for Mandarin and has many problems when used to write Cantonese.

The [Chinese Character Simplification Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Chinese_characters) currently in use in mainland China was formulated by the Committee for Research on Chinese Language Reform in the 1950s. Its design inherited from the simplified character tables of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee. Among these simplified characters, some were simplified based on the principle of [merging homophones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_of_homophonous_characters_in_simplified_Chinese), serving as a transitional step toward the ultimate goal of [Romanization of Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Chinese).

This simplification method has two problems. First, **the merging of homophones is based on Mandarin/Guoyu pronunciation, without considering the pronunciations of non-Mandarin languages**. Therefore, if simplified characters are used to write Cantonese, many characters that have different pronunciations and meanings in Cantonese will be merged into one form, increasing ambiguity and unnecessarily raising communication and learning costs. **The most common examples include "pine squirrel" being read as "loose squirrel," "beard" being read as "must," etc.**, as well as being unable to distinguish between "watch face" and "surface," and "ships enter the canal" becoming ambiguous as "ship only enter canal." Table 1 below documents all such characters.

The second problem is that the simplified character scheme also includes characters simplified by changing phonetic components, and these phonetic component changes are often based on Mandarin pronunciation. This causes **the phonetic components of simplified characters to conflict with actual Cantonese pronunciation. For example, "warship" simplified to "军舰" is easily misread by beginners as "军见"**. Table 2 below summarizes some such characters. Due to the large number, this is an incomplete list, and community contributions are welcome.

<Alert title="Simplified Chinese version of this site">
  Although this site provides a [Simplified Chinese Cantonese version](/yue_hans), it is only for beginners' transitional adaptation. Using traditional characters makes it easier to learn Cantonese pronunciation patterns. Learners should aim to ultimately write Cantonese with traditional characters.
