title: I am a Cantonese learner and I speak English.
description: >
  Cantonese is usually written in Han characters. You will need about 3000
  characters to be functional in Cantonese. Sounds like a lot? Yes, that is a
  lot. That’s why we need a phonetic system while you catch up with the
  characters.

## 1 What is Jyutping?

Jyutping is a way to spell out Cantonese words using only letters (a-z) and
numbers (1-6). If you already speak English (native or not), you only need to
remember a handful of symbols to master Cantonese pronunciation.

In English, the same letter could be pronounced in multiple ways. Look at the
most extreme case: -ough. This four letters sound totally different in cough,
though, through, thought, borough … You get the idea. **English spelling is
highly irregular or inconsistent**.

Jyutping, unlike English, is a system that is designed to be regular. There
should only be ONE way to spell out each sound (phoneme is the technical term),
and there should only be ONE possible sound for each letter. In other words,
Jyutping provides a set of **one-to-one mapping rules** from Cantonese sounds to
latin letters.

This is a system that helps learners master the language. Bear in mind that
Cantonese and English are very different languages. Cantonese is not too
difficult pronunciation-wise (contrary to what you might have heard elsewhere),
but there are things that you need to work on. Fair enough. Jyutping isn’t that
hard, but you need to tackle these three things:

1. **Odd Spelling**: Some letters or spelling conventions may look unfamiliar to
   you.
2. **Slight deviation**: Sometimes the pronunciation seems straightforward, but
   you need to fine tune it a bit to sound more native-like.
3. **New sounds**: I wouldn’t say everything is easy. There are sounds that are
   entirely new to you: weird sounds that you have never heard before (at least
   not exist in English), distinctions that are completely new to your ears.

Don’t worry. You have this guide.

Unlike conventional textbooks, I am not going to give you a long sound
correspondence table (you can still find it [here](/en/jyutping) if you like).
That is counter-productive. I’m going to break down what you need to learn into
the above three different types.

> When describing the sounds I will provide the IPA (International Phonetics
> Alphabet) of them. If you don't know what IPA is, just skip them. All Jyutping
> spellings are styled in boldfaces. Listen to the sample sounds by clicking the

## 2 Odd Spelling

Let’s take a look at vowels first. Cantonese spelling for vowels is quite
regular so let’s just go through them one-by-one. They definitely goes to the
odd spelling category because they don’t correspond to English spelling.

### 2.1 Vowel **aa** & **a**

<Alert color="success">
  **aa** is the long aa sound. The interjection “Aaaaaaaaaaah!” will be “aa” in
  Cantonese. Without the h.
</Alert>

**a** is the short a sound, it sounds similar to the vowel in “sub”. Listen to
these examples.

| aa                            | a                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 三 saam1 <Audio client:load id="saam1" /> | 心 sam1 <Audio client:load id="sam1" /> |
| 山 saan1 <Audio client:load id="saan1" /> | 身 san1 <Audio client:load id="san1" /> |
| 稍 saau2 <Audio client:load id="saau2" /> | 手 sau2 <Audio client:load id="sau2" /> |

### 2.2 Vowel **i**

<Alert color="success">
  In English usually it is written as “ee”, as in “see”, “been”, “peek”, etc.
  The IPA of it is [i]. However there is an exception when **i** is followed by
  **-k** or **-ng**: **-ik** sounds like -ick in English, and **-ing** sounds
  like -ing in English. The IPA turns into [ɪ]. Listen to the following
  examples.
</Alert>

| [i]                         | [ɪ]                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 詩 si1 <Audio client:load id="si1" />   | 識 sik1 <Audio client:load id="sik1" />   |
| 仙 sin1 <Audio client:load id="sin1" /> | 星 sing1 <Audio client:load id="sing1" /> |
| 知 zi1 <Audio client:load id="zi1" />   | 即 zik1 <Audio client:load id="zik1" />   |

### 2.3 Vowel **e**

<Alert color="success">
  This is the e as in pet, bed, etc., but never like the e’s in “be”, or “Pete”.
</Alert>

- 寫 se2 <Audio client:load id="se2" />
- 借 ze3 <Audio client:load id="ze3" />
- 鄭 zeng6 <Audio client:load id="zeng6" />
- 石 sek6 <Audio client:load id="sek6" />

### 2.4 Vowel **o**

<Alert color="success">
  This is the o as in -on, and bot, but never like the o’s in “ho”, “one” or
  “home”. Examples below:
</Alert>

- 歌 go1 <Audio client:load id="go1" />
- 可 ho2 <Audio client:load id="ho2" />
- 過 gwo3 <Audio client:load id="gwo3" />
- 博 bok3 <Audio client:load id="bok3" />
- 裝 zong1 <Audio client:load id="zong1" />

### 2.5 Vowel **u**

<Alert color="success">
  It sounds like -oo- in English (In fact there are two -oo- sounds in English.
  Compare your vowel in foot [ʊ] and food [u] . Most of the time the **u** in
  Jyutping sounds like -oo- as in food, except in **-uk** or **-ung**.
</Alert>

| [u]                       | [ʊ]                           |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 夫 fu1 <Audio client:load id="fu1" /> | 覆 fuk1 <Audio client:load id="fuk1" />   |
| 姑 gu1 <Audio client:load id="gu1" /> | 工 gung1 <Audio client:load id="gung1" /> |

### 2.6 Consonant **j**

<Alert color="success">
  This is the “y” sound in English. See more examples:
</Alert>

- 一 jat1 <Audio client:load id="jat1" />
- 以 ji5 <Audio client:load id="ji5" />
- 夜 je6 <Audio client:load id="je6" />

> Why does Jyutping uses **j** instead of **y** to represent this sound [j], making it so unintuitive? That is because if we use letter y to stand for [j], there will be no letter left to represent the sound [y]. See [vowel **yu**](#41-vowel-yu) for description of this sound.

## 3 Slight deviation

### 3.1 Voicing and aspiration

<Alert color="success">
  Cantonese lacks “voiced plosives”, so these sounds are a bit softer than their
  English counterparts: b, d, g. Technically **b-**, **d-**, **g-** in Jyutping,
  are unaspirated sounds (IPAs are [p], [t], [k]), identical to p, t, k in
  _spy_, _stay_ and _sky_. But don’t worry about the details, just think of it
  as English b, d, g for now. You will definitely be understood.
</Alert>

On the flip side, Cantonese has aspirated plosives: **p-**, **t-**, **k-**,
whose IPAs are [pʰ], [tʰ], [kʰ]. They are identical to the initial p, t, k in
_pea_, _tea_ and _key_. Listen to the examples below:

| Unaspirated                 | Aspirated                   |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 巴 baa1 <Audio client:load id="baa1" /> | 趴 paa1 <Audio client:load id="paa1" /> |
| 打 daa1 <Audio client:load id="daa1" /> | 他 taa1 <Audio client:load id="taa1" /> |
| 家 gaa1 <Audio client:load id="gaa1" /> | 卡 kaa1 <Audio client:load id="kaa1" /> |

### 3.2 Unreleased final plosives

<Alert color="success">
  Finals **-p**, **-t**, **-k** are unrealised, their IPAs are [p̚], [t̚], [k̚].
  Native speakers “swallow” the release and stop right there. Listen to these
  examples, and bear in mind that it will be okay if you can’t mimic the
  “unrealised” version. You will be understood perfectly.
</Alert>

| -p                            | -t                          | -k                          |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 濕 sap1 <Audio client:load id="sap1" />   | 失 sat1 <Audio client:load id="sat1" /> | 塞 sak1 <Audio client:load id="sak1" /> |
| 接 zip3 <Audio client:load id="zip3" />   | 節 zit3 <Audio client:load id="zit3" /> | 脊 zek3 <Audio client:load id="zek3" /> |
| 集 zaap6 <Audio client:load id="zaap6" /> | 活 wut6 <Audio client:load id="wut6" /> | 六 luk6 <Audio client:load id="luk6" /> |

## 4 New sounds

### 4.1 Vowel **yu**

<Alert color="success">
  Try pronouncing “i” and simultaneously rounding your lips. This is the same
  sound as “ü” in German, the IPA of it is [y]. Listen to the examples below:
</Alert>

- 豬 zyu1 <Audio client:load id="zyu1" />
- 村 cyun1 <Audio client:load id="cyun1" />
- 雨 jyu5 <Audio client:load id="jyu5" />

### 4.2 Vowel **eo** & **oe**

<Alert color="success">
  **oe** is the rounded version of **e**, the IPA is [œ]. Many speakers say it
  sounds like ir as in bird, or ur as in fur.
</Alert>

**eo** is the short version of **oe**, the mouth opens smaller than **oe**, the
IPA is [ɵ]. Listen to these examples.

- 率 seot1 <Audio client:load id="seot1" />
- 潤 jeon6 <Audio client:load id="jeon6" />
- 鋸 goe3 <Audio client:load id="goe3" />
- 削 soek3 <Audio client:load id="soek3" />
- 讓 joeng6 <Audio client:load id="joeng6" />

If you can't tell the difference between **eo** and **oe**, that's totally fine. Even
many native speakers can't distinguish them. You will still be perfectly
understood if you mix these two sounds.

### 4.3 Consonant **z** & **c**

<Alert color="success">
  **z** is like the "z" in "zip" or j" in "joe", the IPA is [t͡s] (plus an
  allophonic [t͡ʃ]).
</Alert>

**c** is like the "ch" in "chick", the aspirated version of **z**. The IPA is
[t͡sʰ] (plus an allophonic [t͡ʃʰ]).

| **z**                       | **c**                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 知 zi1 <Audio client:load id="zi1" />   | 詞 ci4 <Audio client:load id="ci4" />   |
| 借 ze3 <Audio client:load id="ze3" />   | 車 ce1 <Audio client:load id="ce1" />   |
| 左 zo2 <Audio client:load id="zo2" />   | 坐 co5 <Audio client:load id="co5" />   |
| 炸 zaa3 <Audio client:load id="zaa3" /> | 查 caa4 <Audio client:load id="caa4" /> |

### 4.4 Consonant **ng**

<Alert color="success">
  In English, the sound ng (IPA [ŋ]) only occurs in syllable-final positions,
  such as _sing_, _wing_, _ping_ etc. But in Cantonese it can appear in both
  syllable-initial and final positions. Listen to the examples below where the
  **ng-** serves as a syllable-inital consonant.
</Alert>

- ngaa4 牙 <Audio client:load id="ngaa4" />
- ngaang6 硬 <Audio client:load id="ngaang6" />
- ngo5 我 <Audio client:load id="ngo5" />
- ngoi6 外 <Audio client:load id="ngoi6" />

You might find difficult to pronounce **ng-**, but don't worry. Many native
speakers fail to pronounce it as well while still can perfectly be understood.

## 5 The Tones

This will be a completely new territory for you. Cantonese is a tonal language,
so the pitch of the word matters. Using the wrong pitch can change the meaning
of a word.

First, let's take a look at all Cantonese tones in a chart:

<img
  src="/img/yue.png"
  width="870"
  height="230"
  loading="lazy"
  alt="Cantonese Tones Chart"
/>

There are **six tones** in Cantonese: high level, high rising, mid level, low
falling, low rising and mid-low level. Listen to the examples below:

| Tone 1 (High level)       | Tone 2 (High rising)      | Tone 3 (Mid level)        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 詩 si1 <Audio client:load id="si1" /> | 史 si2 <Audio client:load id="si2" /> | 試 si3 <Audio client:load id="si3" /> |

| Tone 4 (Low falling)      | Tone 5 (Low rising)       | Tone 6 (Mid-low level)    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 時 si4 <Audio client:load id="si4" /> | 市 si5 <Audio client:load id="si5" /> | 事 si6 <Audio client:load id="si6" /> |

Don’t worry if you cannot distinguish all of them. In real life you can still be
well understood. To get practice, check out our page of
[Tone Exercise](/en/blog/tones), where you can get a comprehensive drill of all
Cantonese tones.

Another fun yet effective way to practice Cantonese tones is through the
Cantonese songs. Check out our
