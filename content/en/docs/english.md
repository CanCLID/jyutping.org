  Cantonese is usually written in Han characters. You will need about 3000 characters to be functional in Cantonese. Sounds like a lot? Yes, that is a lot. That’s why we need a phonetic system while you catch up with the characters.

Jyutping is a way to spell out Cantonese words using only letters (a-z) and numbers (1-6). If you already speak English (native or not), you only need to remember a handful of symbols to master Cantonese pronunciation.

In English, the same letter could be pronounced in multiple ways. Look at the most extreme case: -ough. This four letters sound totally different in cough, though, through, thought, borough … You get the idea. English spelling is highly irregular.

Jyutping, unlike English, is a system that is designed to be regular. There should only be ONE way to spell out each sound (phoneme is the technical term), and there should only be ONE possible sound for each letter. 

This is a system that helps learners master the language, but bear in mind that Cantonese and English are very different languages. Cantonese is not too difficult pronunciation-wise (contrary to what you might have heard elsewhere), but there are things that you need to work on. Fair enough. Jyutping isn’t that hard, but you need to tackle these three things:  


1. Odd Spelling: Some letters or spelling convention may look unfamiliar to you.
2. Slight deviation: Sometimes the pronunciation seems straightforward, but you need to fine tune it a bit to sound more native-like.
3. New sounds: I wouldn’t say everything is easy. There are sounds that are entire new to you: weird sounds that you have never heard before, distinctions that are completely new to your ears. 

Don’t worry. You have this guide.

Unlike conventional textbooks, I am not going to give you a long sound correspondence table. That is counter-productive. I’m going to break down the sounds into three different types.

## Odd Spelling

### Vowels

Let’s take a look at vowels. Cantonese spellings are quite regular so let’s just go through them one-by-one. They definitely goes to the odd spelling category because they don’t correspond to English spelling.

- aa
    This is the long aa sound. The interjection “Aaaaaaaaaaah!” will be “aa” in Cantonese. Without the h.
- a
    This is the short a sound, it sounds similar to the vowel in “sub”. See these examples.
- i 
    In English usually it is written as “ee”, as in “see”, “been”, “peek”, etc. Exception: -ik sounds like -ick, and -ing sounds like -ing. 
- e
    This is the e as in pet, bed, etc., but never like the e’s in “be”, or “Pete”
- o
    This is the o as in -on, and bot, but never like the o’s in “ho”, “one” or “home”.
- u
    It sounds like -oo- in English (In fact there are two -oo- sounds in English. Compare your vowel in foot [ʊ] and food [u] . Most of the time it sounds like -oo- as in food, except in -uk or -ung.


### Consonants
- j
    This is the “y” sound in English. See more examples:
    
Slight deviation

Cantonese lacks “voiced plosives”, so these sounds are a bit softer than their English counterparts: b, d, g. Technically b, d, g, are unaspirated sounds, identical to p, t, k in spy, stay and sky. But don’t worry about the details, just think of it as English b, d, g for now. You will definitely be understood.

Finals -p, -t, -k are unrealised. Native speakers “swallow” the release and stop right there. Listen to these examples, and bear in mind that it will be okay if you can’t mimic the “unrealised” version. You will be understood perfectly.

## New sounds

### yu

This is a new s

### oe

This is the rounded version of e. Many speakers says it sounds like ir as in bird, or ur as in fur. Listen to these examples.

### eo

This is a short version of oe.

### z

This is like 

### c

This is like the ch sound in English.

## Tones

This will be a completely new territory for you. Cantonese is a tonal language, so the pitch of the word matters. Using the wrong pitch can change the meaning of a word. There are SIX tones in Cantonese. Don’t worry if you cannot distinguish all of them. In fact many speakers don’t distinguish all of them.
