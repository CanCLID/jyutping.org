  Cantonese is usually written in Han characters. You will need about 3000 characters to be functional in Cantonese. Sounds like a lot? Yes, that is a lot. That’s why we need a phonetic system while you catch up with the characters.

## What is Jyutping?

Jyutping is a way to spell out Cantonese words using only letters (a-z) and numbers (1-6). If you already speak English (native or not), you only need to remember a handful of symbols to master Cantonese pronunciation.

In English, the same letter could be pronounced in multiple ways. Look at the most extreme case: -ough. This four letters sound totally different in cough, though, through, thought, borough … You get the idea. **English spelling is highly irregular or inconsistent**.

Jyutping, unlike English, is a system that is designed to be regular. There should only be ONE way to spell out each sound (phoneme is the technical term), and there should only be ONE possible sound for each letter. In other words, Jyutping provides an set of **one-to-one mapping rules** from Cantonese sounds to latin letters.

This is a system that helps learners master the language, but bear in mind that Cantonese and English are very different languages. Cantonese is not too difficult pronunciation-wise (contrary to what you might have heard elsewhere), but there are things that you need to work on. Fair enough. Jyutping isn’t that hard, but you need to tackle these three things:

1. **Odd Spelling**: Some letters or spelling convention may look unfamiliar to you.
2. **Slight deviation**: Sometimes the pronunciation seems straightforward, but you need to fine tune it a bit to sound more native-like.
3. **New sounds**: I wouldn’t say everything is easy. There are sounds that are entire new to you: weird sounds that you have never heard before (at least not exist in English), distinctions that are completely new to your ears.

Don’t worry. You have this guide.

Unlike conventional textbooks, I am not going to give you a long sound correspondence table (you can still find it [here](/en/jyutping) if you like). That is counter-productive. I’m going to break down the sounds into the above three different types.

When describing the sounds I will provide the IPA (International Phonetics Alphabet) of them. If you don't know what IPA is, just skip them. Listen to the sample sounds by clicking the {{< audio >}} button and try to imitate the sounds. It might be hard to pronunce for the first time but practice makes perfect.

## Odd Spelling

Let’s take a look at vowels first. Cantonese spellings are quite regular so let’s just go through them one-by-one. They definitely goes to the odd spelling category because they don’t correspond to English spelling.

### aa & a

{{< alert >}}
**aa** is the long aa sound. The interjection “Aaaaaaaaaaah!” will be “aa” in Cantonese. Without the h.

**a** is the short a sound, it sounds similar to the vowel in “sub”. Listen to these examples.

| Examples                          |                                   |                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 三 saam1 {{< audio id="saam1" >}} | 山 saan1 {{< audio id="saan1" >}} | 稍 saau2 {{< audio id="saau2" >}} |
| 心 sam1 {{< audio id="sam1" >}}   | 身 san1 {{< audio id="san1" >}}   | 手 sau2 {{< audio id="sau2" >}}   |

### i

In English usually it is written as “ee”, as in “see”, “been”, “peek”, etc. Exception: -ik sounds like -ick, and -ing sounds like -ing.

### e

This is the e as in pet, bed, etc., but never like the e’s in “be”, or “Pete”

### o

This is the o as in -on, and bot, but never like the o’s in “ho”, “one” or “home”.

### u

It sounds like -oo- in English (In fact there are two -oo- sounds in English. Compare your vowel in foot [ʊ] and food [u] . Most of the time it sounds like -oo- as in food, except in -uk or -ung.

### j

This is the “y” sound in English. See more examples:

- 一 jat1 {{< audio id="jat1" >}}
- 以 ji5 {{< audio id="ji5" >}}
- 夜 je6 {{< audio id="je6" >}}

## Slight deviation

Cantonese lacks “voiced plosives”, so these sounds are a bit softer than their English counterparts: b, d, g. Technically b, d, g, are unaspirated sounds, identical to p, t, k in spy, stay and sky. But don’t worry about the details, just think of it as English b, d, g for now. You will definitely be understood.

Finals -p, -t, -k are unrealised. Native speakers “swallow” the release and stop right there. Listen to these examples, and bear in mind that it will be okay if you can’t mimic the “unrealised” version. You will be understood perfectly.

## New sounds

### yu

Try pronouncing “i” and simultaneously rounding your lips. This is the same sound as “ü” in German, the IPA of it is [y]. Listen to the examples below:

- 豬 zyu1 {{< audio id="zyu1" >}}
- 村 cyun1 {{< audio id="cyun1" >}}
- 雨 jyu5 {{< audio id="jyu5" >}}

### eo & oe

oe is the rounded version of e, the IPA is [œ]. Many speakers says it sounds like ir as in bird, or ur as in fur.

eo is a short version of oe, the mouth opens smaller than eo, the IPA is [ø]. Listen to these examples.

- 率 seot1 {{< audio id="seot1" >}}
- 润 jeon6 {{< audio id="jeon6" >}}
- 鋸 goe3 {{< audio id="goe3" >}}
- 削 soek3 {{< audio id="soek3" >}}
- 让 joeng6 {{< audio id="joeng6" >}}

If you can't tell the difference between eo and oe, that's fine. Even many native speakers can't distinguish them. You will still be perfectly understood if you mix these two sounds.

### z

This is like the "j" in "jiggle", the IPA is [t͡s].

### c

This is the aspirated version of **z**, it is like the "ch" in "chick". The IPA is [t͡sʰ].

## Tones

This will be a completely new territory for you. Cantonese is a tonal language, so the pitch of the word matters. Using the wrong pitch can change the meaning of a word.

First and foremost, let's take a look at all Cantonese tones in a chart:

![image](/img/yue.png)

There are **six tones** in Cantonese: high level, high rising, mid level, low dipping, low rising and mid-low level. Listen to the examples below:

| Tone 1 (High level)           | Tone 2 (High rising)          | Tone 3 (Mid level)            |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 诗 si1 {{< audio id="si1" >}} | 史 si2 {{< audio id="si2" >}} | 试 si3 {{< audio id="si3" >}} |

| Tone 4 (Low dipping)          | Tone 5 (Low rising)           | Tone 6 (Mid-low level)        |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 时 si4 {{< audio id="si4" >}} | 市 si5 {{< audio id="si5" >}} | 事 si6 {{< audio id="si6" >}} |

Don’t worry if you cannot distinguish all of them. In real life you can still be well understood even if you don't distinguish all of them.
